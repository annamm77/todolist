# todolist react app
_The goal of this project is to re-learn React, slowly but surely_

### todos... for todolist...
* mess around with ui components and learn what state means, think about styling options
* consider adding react router for multipage views
* consider using redux for "fun" to store global vars ex. logged-in user name 
* build backend, maybe express api connecting to sql db
